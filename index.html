        I got job in cafeteria of NMC (National Medical Center). I give people cofee, bread, juice and some other things. i used to provide food to the patients. I give 12 hours of my day to job. After nine days of regular working. One day i though why not go to meet my teacher. I had not met my teacher for a long time. So after work i came home and prepared to meet them. before that i go mosque and perform my magrib prayers. i came home and started my bike to go but i forget my helmet in home. when i remembered, i forget my helmet home till i crossed halfway.

So i turn my bike on a service road and continue my going. Unfortunately my bike headlight was not working well. So in dark i can't see properly. I go in the road and in there the street light was off. I go with 70 mph speed and suddenly i fall down. Because there was a big hole on the road and my bike hit it. I did'nt control my bike and i fall down. I got injured on my forehead and i break my right hand bone. Thank GOD Some people pick me up and drop me in near hospital. They also call my family to tall them in did accedent. My family came to me after my bandage was complete. They all are so sad. After this i came home with my family. My dad was in office so they don't come at hospital so when i reach home they are there. They also angry and sad but they don't speak anything.
